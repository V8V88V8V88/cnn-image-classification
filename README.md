# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Train the CNN model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
3. Evaluate the model on the test set and display the accuracy.
4. Visualize training history and predictions.

## Training

To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python <your_script_name>.py
```

## Results

After training, the model's accuracy on the test set will be printed. The training and validation accuracy/loss will be plotted.
